# Introduction
Gun violence remains a pressing issue in many urban areas, especially for an international city such as New York. It is crucial to note that gun violence is not only a public safety concern but also a reflection of broader societal challenges, such as inequality and access to resources. Through this study, we hope to contribute to the ongoing discourse on improving community safety and equity.

By analyzing the NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic), we aim to understand the patterns and factors contributing to these incidents, offering insights that may aid in developing preventative measures,or enhance the security for specific region with high shooting incident rate. This dataset provides detailed information on the location, time, and demographic profiles of victims and perpetrators, making it a valuable resource for exploring the insight of these incidents. 

We will explore the data through the researches listed below:

1. Crime Rate Differences by Region: Investigate the variations in crime rates across different boroughs and neighborhoods in New York City to identify regional disparities and potential influencing factors.

2. Cyclic Patterns of Crime: Analyze the distribution of crimes over time, focusing on seasonal, weekly, monthly, or daily trends, to identify peak periods and understand temporal variations in gun violence incidents.

3. Information about the victims and their relationship with Perpetrator: Further investigation into specific details about the victims, such as age, gender, and race, can help us better protect and manage specific groups of people.

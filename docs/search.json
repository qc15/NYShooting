    "text": "1 Introduction\nGun violence remains a pressing issue in many urban areas, especially for an international city such as New York. It is crucial to note that gun violence is not only a public safety concern but also a reflection of broader societal challenges, such as inequality and access to resources. Through this study, we hope to contribute to the ongoing discourse on improving community safety and equity.\nBy analyzing the NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic), we aim to understand the patterns and factors contributing to these incidents, offering insights that may aid in developing preventative measures,or enhance the security for specific region with high shooting incident rate. This dataset provides detailed information on the location, time, and demographic profiles of victims and perpetrators, making it a valuable resource for exploring the insight of these incidents.\nWe will explore the data through the researches listed below: 1,Crime Rate Differences by Region: Investigate the variations in crime rates across different boroughs and neighborhoods in New York City to identify regional disparities and potential influencing factors.\n2,Crime Rate Differences by Location Classification: To be more specific, investigate the variations in crime rates across different locations. Combining with the formal research, exploring the furthur relationship between shooting crime and Region+Location.\n3,Temporal Patterns of Crime: Analyze the distribution of crimes over time, focusing on seasonal, monthly, or daily trends, to identify peak periods and understand temporal variations in gun violence incidents.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, we take advantage of a dataset recording each shooting incident in NYC from 2006 to 2023. The data is collected quarterly by New York Police Department (NYPD) and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being published on the NYPD website. This dataset is updated annually. It contains 28562 rows and 21 columns, with each row representing a single shooting incident. The 21 columns provide detailed information about each incident, such as the location, time, and details about the suspect and victim. This dataset is available in multiple formats, including CSV, XML, etc. For this project, we imported the data by downloading it in CSV format from the website “https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8/about_data”.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(DataExplorer)\ndf = read.csv(\"data/raw/NYPD_Shooting_Incident_Data.csv\")\ndf[df == \"\"] &lt;- NA\nplot_missing(df, title = \"Distribution of Missing Values for Each Variable\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot “Distribution of Missing Values for Each Variable”, we can see that 16 columns contain either no missing values or very small number of missing values. Each of the columns PERP_RACE, PERP_SEX, and PERP_AGE_GROUP contains about 32.5% missing values. These columns record information about perpetrators. About a half of values are missing in LOCATION_DESC, which records the location of the shooting incident. Finally, the columns LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC and LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC both contain 89.62% missing values. LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC is a column showing whether the incident is outdoor or indoor. LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC is a column showing whether the kind of location of the shooting incident (e.g. commercial, street, housing, vehicle, etc.)\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(naniar)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n# https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/naniar/versions/1.1.0/topics/gg_miss_upset\ngg_miss_upset(df, nsets = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the intersection of missing values among multiple variables. It shows that all of the missing values in the columns LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC and LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC appear together (the number of missing values in these two columns: \\(28562 \\times 0.8962 \\approx 25597\\) and the sum of the frequencies of the bins except the 5th bin above is 25596). Except the 59 intersection of missing values in the columns “Latitude, Longitude, and Lon_Lat”, all intersections include these two columns.\nIn addition, it shows that all of the missing values in the three columns Latitude, Longitude, and Lon_Lat appear at the same time (i.e. one column has a missing value only when other two columns also have missing values) since the plot “Distribution of Missing Values for Each Variable” shows each of them has only \\(28562 \\times 0.21\\% \\approx 59\\) missing values.\nSimilarly, all of the missing values in the columns PERP_SEX and PERP_RACE appear at the same time. This is because the plot “Distribution of Missing Values for Each Variable” shows each of them has only \\(28562 \\times 0.326 \\approx 9311\\) and the sum of the frequency of the third column and the fourth column is 9310. Notice that if these two columns’ missing values appear, the value of the column PERP_AGE_GROUP is also missing, but not the other way around (PERP_AGE_GROUP has around 1285 additional missing values that only accompany with the missing values of the columns LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC and LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC).",

    "text": "4 number of incidents each year\n\n\nCode\ncrime_data &lt;- df |&gt;\n  mutate(YearMonth = format(as.Date(OCCUR_DATE), \"%Y-%m\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(YearMonth, BORO) |&gt;\n  summarise(IncidentCount = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncrime_data &lt;- df |&gt;\n  mutate(YearMonth = format(as.Date(OCCUR_DATE, \"%m/%d/%Y\"), \"%Y-%m\"))\n\nall_combinations &lt;- crime_data |&gt;\n  distinct(YearMonth, BORO) |&gt;\n  complete(YearMonth, BORO, fill = list(IncidentCount = 0))\n\ncrime_data_complete &lt;- crime_data |&gt;\n  group_by(YearMonth, BORO) |&gt;\n  summarise(IncidentCount = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  right_join(all_combinations, by = c(\"YearMonth\", \"BORO\")) |&gt;\n  replace_na(list(IncidentCount = 0)) |&gt;\n  mutate(YearMonth = as.Date(paste0(YearMonth, \"-01\"), format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")) |&gt;\n  arrange(YearMonth)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Reorder BORO based on the observed rank\ncrime_data_complete$BORO &lt;- factor(\n  crime_data_complete$BORO,\n  levels = c(\"BROOKLYN\", \"BRONX\", \"QUEENS\", \"MANHATTAN\", \"STATEN ISLAND\")\n)\n\nggplot(crime_data_complete, aes(x = YearMonth, y = IncidentCount, color = BORO, group = BORO)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +  # Add a line for each BORO\n  labs(title = \"Number of Incidents Over Time by Borough\",\n       x = \"Year-Month\", y = \"Number of Incidents\", color = \"Borough\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot above, we found that Brooklyn almost always has the highest number of incidents in each month and Bronx almost has the second-highest number of incidents in each month. These two boroughs also have the most unstable number of incidents in each month. Queens and Manhattan contain similar number of incidents in each month. The number of incidents in Staten Island is smallest among all boroughs.\nIt is also noticeable that the number of incidents in each borough decreases to one level in 2013-2016 (especially for Brooklyn and Bronx) and decreases to another level in 2017-2019, but there exists a sharp increase in 2020, which is probably due to the pandemic and the police brutality protests in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. The number of incidents in Brooklyn and Bronx, after 2020, returns back to a level similar to the level in 2013-2016, while it didn’t decrease until 2023 in Queens and Manhattan.\nFrom the plot above, we find that there might exist a cyclic pattern in boroughs other than Staten Island, where each year is a cycle. To give a closer look at it, we facet this plot by year, which is shown below.\n\n\nCode\ncrime_data_complete &lt;- crime_data_complete |&gt;\n  mutate(Year = format(as.Date(paste0(YearMonth, \"-01\"), \"%Y-%m-%d\"), \"%Y\"))  # Extract year\n\nggplot(crime_data_complete, aes(x = YearMonth, y = IncidentCount, color = BORO, group = BORO)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +  # Add a line for each BORO\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of Incidents Over Each Year by Borough\",\n    x = \"Year-Month\", y = \"Number of Incidents\", color = \"Borough\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Year, scales = \"free_x\")  # Facet by year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the number of shooting incidents over each year in each borough. From the plot, we can see that the cyclic pattern is not very strong. However, it shows that the number of shooting incidents in summer is larger than the number of shooting in other months, especially for Brooklyn and Bronx.\n\n\n5 Cleveland dot plot: VIC_SEX\n\n\nCode\ndata_summary &lt;- crime_data |&gt;\n  group_by(YEAR, VIC_SEX, VIC_RACE) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\nggplot(data_summary, aes(x = Count, y = as.factor(YEAR), color = VIC_SEX)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +  # Add points for each sex\n  labs(title = \"Cleveland Dot Plot of Victim Sex by Year (Faceted by Race)\",\n       x = \"Incident Count\", y = \"Year\", color = \"Victim Sex\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"pink\", \"blue\", \"gray\"),\n    labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\", \"Unknown\")\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ VIC_RACE, scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows that for all races, the number of male victims is almost always larger than the number of female victims in each year. The number of female victims in each year is relatively stable compared to the number of male victims for all races. We also noticed that Black, White Hispanic, and Black Hispanic are races that have the top 3 number of victims in each year.\n\n\n6 Heatmap of Incidents by Time and Borough\n\n\nCode\ncrime_data_time_boro &lt;- crime_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    OCCUR_TIME = hms::as_hms(OCCUR_TIME),\n    TimePeriod = floor(hour(OCCUR_TIME) / 2) * 2\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(BORO, TimePeriod) |&gt;\n  summarise(IncidentCount = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(BORO = factor(BORO, levels = c(\"BROOKLYN\", \"BRONX\", \"QUEENS\", \"MANHATTAN\", \"STATEN ISLAND\")))\n\nggplot(crime_data_time_boro, aes(x = TimePeriod, y = BORO, fill = IncidentCount)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 22, by = 2), labels = paste0(seq(0, 22, by = 2), \"-\", seq(2, 24, by = 2))) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"white\", high = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Incidents by Time and Borough\",\n       x = \"Time Period (2-hour intervals)\", y = \"Borough\", fill = \"Incident Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap above shows the number of incidents across different time periods and boroughs. It divides the exact time of shooting incident into 12 periods, each of which consists of 2 hours. From the plot, we can find for all boroughs, the number of incidents increases gradually after 10:00. It reaches the peak in the periods 22:00-00:00 and 0:00-2:00, which is what we expected. The number of incidents decreases after 2:00 and reaches the minimum value in 8:00-10:00. The amount of decrease is more intense from the period 4:00-6:00 to the period 6:00-8:00 compared to changes in other periods. This pattern exists in all boroughs.\n\n\nCode\ndf_clean_age &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(VIC_AGE_GROUP != \"1022\", PERP_AGE_GROUP != \"1020\", PERP_AGE_GROUP != \"(null)\", PERP_AGE_GROUP != \"\", PERP_AGE_GROUP != \"940\", PERP_AGE_GROUP != \"224\", PERP_AGE_GROUP != \"1028\")  # Remove invalid rows\n\nage_table &lt;- table(df_clean_age$PERP_AGE_GROUP, df_clean_age$VIC_AGE_GROUP)\n\nage_table_long &lt;- as.data.frame(as.table(age_table))\n\ncolnames(age_table_long) &lt;- c(\"PERP_AGE_GROUP\", \"VIC_AGE_GROUP\", \"Count\")\n\nggplot(age_table_long, aes(x = PERP_AGE_GROUP, y = VIC_AGE_GROUP, fill = Count)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +  # Add white borders around tiles\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Blues\", direction = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Heatmap of Perpetrator and Victim Age Groups\",\n    x = \"Perpetrator Age Group\",\n    y = \"Victim Age Group\",\n    fill = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)  # Rotate x-axis labels for readability\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap above shows the heatmap of age groups of perpetrators and victims. From the plot, we can see that the victims in 18-24 and 25-44 are much more than victims in other age groups. Other than perpetrators over 65 years old, almost perpetrators in every age group are more likely to shoot victims who are between 18-44 years old. In addition, we find that the perpetrators in 18-24 years old are more likely to shoot vitims who are 18-24 years old instead of victims who are 25-44 years old, while the perpetrators in 25-44 years old are more likely to shoot victims who are 25-44 years old instead of victims who are 18-24 years old. This is reasonable because individuals in similar age groups are more likely to interact within the same social environments.",
